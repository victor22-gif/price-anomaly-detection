# ✈️ Flight Price Anomaly Detection

This project identifies **unusual pricing patterns** in flight data using statistical anomaly detection techniques.

## 📁 Project Structure


## 🔍 What I Did

- Loaded and explored a structured flight pricing dataset
- Engineered features like `Journey_day`, `Dep_hour`, and `Duration_mins`
- Applied **IQR** and **Z-score** methods to detect unusually high prices
- Created a **Price-per-minute** metric to identify potential good deals
- Flagged the top 10% most efficient flights and overpriced entries
- Documented assumptions and scoring thresholds

## 📊 Techniques Used

- Pandas, NumPy
- IQR and z-score anomaly detection
- Simple custom scoring
- Jupyter Notebook (well-commented and structured)

## ✅ Deliverables

- 📓 A clean, explainable notebook
- 📁 Dataset used for testing
- 🧾 This README explaining everything clearly
